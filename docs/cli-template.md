# üß† CLI

`playground` CLI is available in `scripts/cli/playground`.
It makes so much easier to use the playground and reduces a lot the Docker knowledge required !

## üöú Setup

### ü¶∂ Setup PATH

Add it to your `PATH` environment variable by adding this in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH=/path/to/kafka-docker-playground/scripts/cli:$PATH
```

> [!WARNING]
> The bash script generated by [bashly](https://bashly.dannyb.co/) can run in any shell, but require that bash 4 or higher is installed.
> Mac users can upgrade bash by running `brew install bash`

### ‚ö° Setup completion

A Bash completion file is also available in `scripts/cli/completions.bash`.

In order to be able to use completion with the CLI, you just need to add this in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
source /path/to/kafka-docker-playground/scripts/cli/completions.bash
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you use ZSH, but **not** `Oh-My-Zsh`, please check [this](https://bashly.dannyb.co/advanced/bash-completion/#completions-in-zsh).
