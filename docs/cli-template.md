# üß† CLI

`playground` CLI is available in `scripts/cli/playground`.
It makes so much easier to use the playground and reduces a lot the Docker knowledge required !

## üöú Setup

### ü¶∂ Setup PATH

Add it to your `PATH` environment variable by adding this in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH=/path/to/kafka-docker-playground/scripts/cli:$PATH
```

> [!WARNING]
> The bash script generated by [bashly](https://bashly.dannyb.co/) can run in any shell, but require that bash 4 or higher is installed.
> Mac users can upgrade bash by running `brew install bash`

### ‚ö° Setup completion

A Bash completion file is also available in `scripts/cli/completions.bash`.

In order to be able to use completion with the CLI, you just need to add this in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
source /path/to/kafka-docker-playground/scripts/cli/completions.bash
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you use ZSH, but **not** `Oh-My-Zsh`, please check [this](https://bashly.dannyb.co/advanced/bash-completion/#completions-in-zsh).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Config file 

CLI can be configured using `config.ini` [file](https://github.com/vdesabou/kafka-docker-playground/blob/master/scripts/cli/config.ini)

```ini
;; Configuration file for playground CLI

;; You can configure the path to your config.ini file using CONFIG_FILE environment variable
;; export CONFIG_FILE="path/to/config.ini"

; editor to use to open files
editor = code

; list (comma separated) of folders where to search for zip or jar
; Current folder is always included
; examples:
; folder_zip_or_jar = ~/Downloads,~/Documents/github/kafka-connect-*
folder_zip_or_jar = ~/Downloads
```

You can configure the path to your own config.ini file using `CONFIG_FILE` environment variable:

```bash
export CONFIG_FILE="/path/to/config.ini"
```
